#### Labs with solutions (python and java): 
- [https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs](https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs)
- Main libraries: 
  - ***Java***: [Jena](https://jena.apache.org/index.html): complete library to create RDF triples, execute SPARQL queries, access ontology data, perform RDFS and OWL reasoning (although not built-in OWL 2 reasoning).
  - ***Python***: [Owlready2](https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/) (good option to access an already created ontology), [SPARQLWrapper](https://pypi.org/project/SPARQLWrapper/) (connection to an SPARQL Endpoint), [RDFlib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) (manipulation and access of local RDF graphs), [OWL-RL](https://pypi.org/project/owlrl/5.2.1/) (very easy to expand and RDF graph with RDFS or OWL 2 RL entailments), [OWL2Vec*](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/OWL2Vec-Star) (entity and lexical embeddings from OWL 2 ontologies).
- [Prot√©ge](https://protege.stanford.edu/) is used as ontology editor.
- Coursework: [description and datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WlINYleyUdV-rQst8qqBefiixwv9yGvR?usp=sharing).
